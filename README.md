## FAQ

Q: Why isn't `mod x` on any of the lists?

A: A list of mods that aren't recommended (and why) can be found [here](mods-n-stuff/not-recommended.md). Similarly, a list of situational performance mods which may help in some specific scenarios can be found [here](mods-n-stuff/additions.md)

Q: Will these work on PojavLauncher?

A: Haven't tested & I don't have the resources to do so. Don't expect official support!

Q: Why do this? Why build over someone else's work?

A: I wanted to fork the project to keep it alive as it contains vital information most players with bad computers need to play at a playable framerate.
