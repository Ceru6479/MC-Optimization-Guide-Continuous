### Celeritas

Celeritas is a port of Embeddium for various versions of Minecraft. In field-testing I've found this to be significantly smoother than any other optimization mod.

Current known incompatibilities (as of Build 2.4.0-Dev3-20260215):

- Chunk Animator (Mod does not do anything, however the game does not crash)
- Embeddium (This is basically that anyway)
- LittleTiles (No LT blocks will render, however the game does not crash)
- Nothirium (Will crash when booting)
- Optifine.
- Sodium (This is basically that anyway)
- Vintagium & its forks (Will crash when booting)

I can't guarantee if this mod will work with shaders or not.
