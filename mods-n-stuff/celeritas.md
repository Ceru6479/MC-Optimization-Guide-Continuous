Celeritas

Celeritas is a port of Embeddium for various versions of Minecraft, and is currently easily obtainable for 1.12.2 via Kappa Maintainer's repo: https://github.com/kappa-maintainer/Celeritas-auto-build/releases.

As of 2/14/26; Celeritas will run on Forge 1.12.2 without any further modification, but I can't guarantee mod stability.

Current known incompatibilities:

    Chunk Animator (Celeritas itself has a similar-ish setting)
    LittleTiles
    Nothirium
    Optifine
    Vintagium & its forks

Shader support isn't currently available, however it is W.I.P.
