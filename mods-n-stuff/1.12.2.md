## Cleanroom Loader

**NOTE:** Do not use MixinBooter/MixinBootstrap and ConfigAnytime! They're not necessary on Cleanroom.

| Mod | Notes | Client/Server |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Alfheim Lighting Engine | - | Server |
| CensoredASM | - | Both |
| Entity Culling | There are 2 mods going by this name, the one I'd recommend is by tr7zw. | Client |
| Fixeroo | - | Both |
| Nothirium | If used with CensoredASM; disable `OnDemandAnimatedTextures` or install Naughthirium alongside this. Otherwise texture animations fail completely! | Client |
| StellarCore | Disable `NBTTagImprovements`, `ParallelModelLoader`, `ResourceExistStateCache` and `ResourceLocationCanonicalization` as CensoredASM and VintageFix already have similar optimizations. | Both |
| UniversalTweaks | - | Both |
| VintageFix | You may have to disable `mixin.dynamic_resources` depending on modpack (or if you want to use StellarCore's `ParallelModelLoader`). | Both |
