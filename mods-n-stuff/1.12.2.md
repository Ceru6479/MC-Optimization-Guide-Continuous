## Cleanroom Loader

**NOTE:** Do not use MixinBooter/MixinBootstrap and ConfigAnytime! They're not necessary on Cleanroom.

| Mod | Notes | Client/Server |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Alfheim Lighting Engine | - | Server |
| CensoredASM | If you are using Nothirium; disabled OnDemandAnimatedTextures from the config, or install Naughthirium.  | Both |
| Entity Culling | There are 2 mods going by that name, the one I'd recommend is by tr7zw. [There is an edge case where Entity Culling can crash the game](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/issues/2985) | Client |
| Fixeroo | - | Both |
| Nothirium | Not compatible with Celeritas, you have to use one or the other | Client |
| StellarCore | Disable `NBTTagImprovements`, `ParallelModelLoader`, `ResourceExistStateCache` and `ResourceLocationCanonicalization` as CensoredASM and VintageFix already have similar optimizations. | Both |
| UniversalTweaks | - | Both |
| VintageFix | You may have to | Both |

### Celeritas

Celeritas is a port of Embeddium for various versions of Minecraft, and is currently easily obtainable for 1.12.2 via Kappa Maintainer's repo: https://github.com/kappa-maintainer/Celeritas-auto-build/releases.

As of 2/14/26; Celeritas will run on Forge 1.12.2 without any further modification, but I can't guarantee mod stability.

Current known incompatibilities:
- Chunk Animator (Celeritas itself has a similar-ish setting)
- LittleTiles
- Nothirium
- Optifine
- Vintagium & its forks 

Shader support isn't currently available, however it is W.I.P.
