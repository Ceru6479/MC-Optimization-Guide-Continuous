# Game loading times

This was tested with FTB Interactions Remastered 1.14.1, with a fresh cache to ensure times were consistent. Both Java 21 & 25 are loaded with CleanroomMC 0.3.30 Alpha. All versions of Java were sourced from Eclipse Adoptium, with time measured by VintageFix 0.6.2.

Java 8 has middling performance, Java 21 is a major upgrade of itself, and Java 25 is the best around.
(In percentages, the jump from 8 to 21 is 30%, while 21 to 25 is 17%)
